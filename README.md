# Todo and Schedule App

A simple, responsive Todo and Schedule application built using **React** and **Vite**. This app allows users to create, manage, and store their todos and schedules. The data is persisted in the browser's local storage, ensuring that it stays even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Create Todos**: Add new todos with a name, purpose, and end date.
- **Add Tasks to Todos**: For each todo, users can add multiple tasks.
- **Edit and Delete Tasks**: Manage tasks by editing or deleting them as needed.
- **Schedule Management**: Organize your tasks with end dates.
- **Local Storage**: Todos and tasks are saved in local storage for persistence.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design to ensure smooth usability across devices.

- **Edit Tasks**: Edit any task by clicking the edit button next to it.
